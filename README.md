## Key Project:
Analyzing Age Differences at Death Between Left-Handed and Right-Handed Individuals:
During my traineeship, I spearheaded a project that delved into the intriguing topic of life expectancy differences between left-handed and right-handed people. Utilizing advanced statistical methods, I analyzed extensive mortality data from the United States and applied Bayesian statistics to assess the impact of left-handedness on age at death.

## Highlights of the Project:
- Employed Bayesian statistical techniques to analyze death distribution data and historical surveys on left-handedness.
- Investigated claims from previous studies about the significant age gap at death between left-handed and right-handed individuals.
- Successfully identified and quantified the age difference, revealing a notable gap that varied across different eras (6.4 years in 1990 and 3.4 years in 2018).
- The project underscored the influence of societal attitudes towards left-handedness over time and its impact on statistical findings
